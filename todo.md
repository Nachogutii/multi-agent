# Implementation Notes

## Bot Behavior Improvements
- Bot needs better understanding of closing phases
- Currently only responds with "Thank you for your time." during closing
- Need to improve phase detection accuracy

## Evaluator Enhancements
- Evaluator should not evaluate after closing phase
- Need to improve evaluator for better scorecard generation
- Evaluation should automatically appear after closing without requiring "/feedback" command

## Priority Tasks
1. Fix phase detection system
2. Implement proper evaluation timing (after closing)
3. Enhance evaluator scoring system
4. Improve bot's closing phase responses
