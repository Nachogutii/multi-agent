Functional:
- Scenario selection - On arrival as a user, I would like to choose a scenario instead of getting a random scenario generated for me
- I can't go back to the previous chat once I have seen the feedback. It would be cool to check the conversation again ✅
- User Login / Session detection - We can log somewhere who was the ambassador
- Persistence - We store assessment results in to a DB 

UI / UX:
- The feedback page needs work. We can use chart libraries like Chart.js to make this better ✅
- The 'speak' button clears previous input from the user, but maybe the user just needs a bit of time to think. Clicking Speak again should not delete previous input on the message box ✅
- If the user hits the 'speak' button and the customer is still talking, the talking should be silenced 🚨
